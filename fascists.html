		<h1>Fascists vs. Liberals</h1>
			<p>
				Fascists vs. Liberals is a social deduction party game. Generally, the gameplay is more fun if you can get the maximum number of possible players.<br>
				To start, all players are randomly, and secretly, given an ID card telling them if they are a Liberal or a Fascist for that game.<br>
				There are tiles that have Liberal or Fascist written on them. These represent policies that need to be passed.<br>
				Two players participate in each round and then play proceeds clockwise.<br>
				The first of the two players picks up the top three tiles from the policy deck and discards one and then hands the other two to the second player.<br>
				The second player then has to choose from the remaining two tiles which policy to pass. Liberals want to pass Liberal policies, and Fascists want to pass Fascist policies.<br>
				Whichever of the two sides passes five of their policies first, wins!<br>
