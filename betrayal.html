		<h1>Betrayal at a Mansion on a Mountain</h1>
			<p>
				Betrayal at a Mansion on a Mountain is an adventure/sci-fi/horror board game. <br>
				Players start the game as allies while they explore the mansion and look for clues and tools to help them later in their adventure.<br>
				Once a special event has been triggered, that is when the betrayal really begins!<br>
				One player then becomes the "betrayer" and the game becomes a one versus all. The goal of the "betrayer" is generally to kill all the other players.<br>
				But, if the players can manage to foil the plans of the "betrayer", the players win and the day is saved!<br>
