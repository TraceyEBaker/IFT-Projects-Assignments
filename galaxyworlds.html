				Galaxy Worlds in one of my favorite two player games!  It's a deck building game where you act as a defender of space! <br>
				There are several different factions of spaceships under your control. Some factions are powerful fighters, while other factions' strength lies in their defense. <br>
				You and your opponent will take alternating turns to attempt to do damage to each other. You will start with 50 health, and whomever runs out of health first, loses. <br>
				There is also a free mobile version of this game, but extra expansions and online play will be charged a small fee.
