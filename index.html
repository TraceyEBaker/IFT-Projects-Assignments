				Hello World! My name is Tracey Baker and I love board games. I've been playing board games regularly since I was a child and play at least 10 new games a year. <br>
				Playing so many new games is made possible by an event my friends and I call Board Game Weekend. It happens four times a year at our friend Jon's home. <br>
				Between 25 and 30 of us come from around the country to sit down for 48 hours and play board games together. <br>
				Everyone brings their collections and we try to coordinate so we don't have multiple copies of the same game, therefore leaving less stuff for people traveling long distances to take with them. <br>
				I hope to spread some of the joy that I get playing games with my friends onto others! I based my recommendations on group size, but also made sure to include a variety of game genres.<br>
